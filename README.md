# Advanced-Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
This study aims to develop an advanced model for Parkin-son’s disease(PD) detection using diverse voice recordings,including sustained vowels,continuous speech,andotherau-dio samples.By analyzing multiple acousticfeatures—such as jitter,shimmer,harmonics-to-noiseratio,and MFCCs the study seeks to identify key vocal characteristics that distin-guish PD patients from healthy controls.Supervised clas-sifcation algorithms,including ANN neuralnetworks,were em-ployed in this research,achieving a peakaccuracy of 79.83 %,which surpasses the average clinical diagnosis accuracy of non-experts(73.8%).Using a publicly available dataset,this study aspires to create an accessible,non-invasive,speech-based diagnostic tool for early diagnosis and on going moni-toring of Parkinson’s through voice analysis.
